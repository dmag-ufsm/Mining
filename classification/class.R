# PLACE ~ SHIELDS 
#fitPlot(df3, df3$Place, df3$Shields, "Classification by x = Shield count: 3 players")

#fitPlot(df7, df7$Place, df7$Shields, "Classification by x = Shield count: 7 players")
# Conclusion 1:
# Players with lots of shields (but not excessively so (> 9)) tend to score better,
# proving that an agressive playstyle may be worth the investment.


# PLACE ~ TREASURY VP (NÂº COINS)
#fitPlot(df3, df3$Place, df3$VP.from.Treasury.Contents, "Classification by x = VP Treasury: 3 players")
#fitPlot(df4, df4$Place, df4$VP.from.Treasury.Contents, "Classification by x = VP Treasury: 4 players")

#fitPlot(df7, df7$Place, df7$VP.from.Treasury.Contents, "Classification by x = VP Treasury: 7 players")
# Conclusion 2:
# Players that don't spend many coins tend to score better (< 7 players)


# PLACE ~ WONDER VP
#fitPlot(df3, df3$Place, df3$VP.from.Wonder, "Classification by x = VP Wonder: 3 players")

#fitPlot(df7, df7$Place, df7$VP.from.Wonder, "Classification by x = VP Wonder: 7 players")
# Conclusion 3:
# Interestingly, top players don't tend to have that much VPs from Wonders -- this is due to the fact
# that they tend to play with side B, which provides less VPs in general.
